AI tool used -> Cursor

Using Cursor to give the base structure for each of my comment headings for my app's methods 
was very useful as i just had to input the requirements of the question, get the output from 
Cursor, and then checking through my individual classes to check whether the changes made by 
Cursor was actually accurate in serving as headers, allowing me to save an hour or two in 
adding individual comment headers to my methods.
