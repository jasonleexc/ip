AI tool used -> Cursor

Using Cursor to give the base structure for each of my comment headings for my app's methods 
was very useful as i just had to input the requirements of the question, get the output from 
Cursor, and then checking through my individual classes to check whether the changes made by 
Cursor was actually accurate in serving as headers, allowing me to save an hour or two in 
adding individual comment headers to my methods.

Using Cursor to help implement test cases for me to run helped save me time in thinking of edge 
cases for my chatbot. This allowed me to save a significant amount of time thinking about 
potential wrong inputs by users and cases to check for. I just had to check for the accuracy of
implementation of the test cases vis-a-vis my chatbot's methods.
